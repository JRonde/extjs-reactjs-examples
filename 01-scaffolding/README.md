# 01 Scaffolding

This subdirectory contains an app already generated with create-react-app, as
described in the Scaffolding blog post (link here)

Make sure you have yarn installed.

To run the app server:

```
$ cd my-app
$ yarn start
```

A browser window will automatically open and will load the app.

As you make edits to the sources in the my-app/ directory, the browser will
automatically refresh to reflect your changes.

The blog post suggetss some simple edits to see this in action.

For a quick start, you can edit my-app/src/App.js and comment out one of the two
import lines, for logo.svg OR logo2.svg.
