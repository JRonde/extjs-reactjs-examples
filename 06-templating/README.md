# 06 Templating


This subdirectory contains apps already generated with create-react-app, as
described in the Static and Config Members blog post (link here).  The source code has been
modified to include the examples in the blog post so you can see it in action.

For each of the following examples, cd into the directory and run ```npm
install``` followeed by ```npm run```

See src/App.js in each of the example directories.
