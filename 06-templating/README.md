# 06 Ext JS to React: Templating

In these examples we explore how to create templated classes similar to what you
would do when creating HTML templates using Ext JS XTemplate

## Example Projects

 - [a-simple-templating](./a-simple-templating): simple React component whose
 content is fed from a data object using templating syntax
 - [b-advanced-templating](./b-advanced-templating): a somewhat more advanced 
 templating example that uses a class method owned by the component rendering
 the template.  This is similar to using member functions in Ext JS templates.
